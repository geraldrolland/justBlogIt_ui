# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

how to use the codebase to build the app using vsing vscode:
---------------------------------------------------------
type the command: $npm install 
this installs the dependencies in the package.json file among the files in the repo

next: $npm run dev
this command starts the development server and generates the url with which you can open the app in your browser
click on the url or copy and paste in your browser
